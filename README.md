# Loafing Around Cambridge🍞🌟

Welcome to "Loafing Around Cambridge"! This repository is dedicated to exploring the various bakeries and bread offerings in Cambridge, with the ultimate goal of finding the best bread in the city. We have created a table that rates the bread based on several categories, including type, appearance, crust, crumb texture, and taste. We are bread enthusiasts on a mission to uncover the most delicious and high-quality bread in the city. We invite you to join us in this exciting journey of discovery, and to share your own ratings and opinions on the breads you try in Cambridge. Let's find the best bread together!

## Ratings🌟👍

[All rated breads can be found here](./bread.md)

## Categories📋🧐

The categories in the table are:

**Name**: Name of the bread.

**Type**: The type of bread being rated, such as sourdough, whole wheat, rye, or baguette.      

**Appearance**: The overall appearance of the bread, including its shape, size, and colour. Use adjectives like: _uniform, smooth, irregular, small, big_

**Crust**: The quality of the outer layer of the bread, including its texture and flavor. Use adjectives like: _crispy, chewy, thick, thin, tough_

**Crumb/Texture**: The crumb of bread refers to the soft, inner part of the bread. A good crumb should be soft and springy, with a uniform texture and small air pockets throughout. The crumb should also be moist, without being too dense or dry. Use adjectives like: _soft, spongy, dense, moist, fluffy, chewy_

**Taste**: The flavor and aroma of the bread. This is the most important column, but it is also the most subjective one. If you strongly disagree with the rating of a bread create a pull request with your own rating of the bread. _Use a score from very bad 0 to 10 very good._ 

**Store**: Bakery or store where the bread can be bought. 

**Price**: Price of the bread.

**Date**: Date when the bread was tested. [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)

**Tester(s)**: Name and/or number of testers who contributed to the rating of the bread.
